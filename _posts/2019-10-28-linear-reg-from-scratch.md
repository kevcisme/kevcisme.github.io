title: Linear Regression from Scratch
---

If you're diligently following along, you may have seen that I'm doing a series on machine learning models from scratch.

If you aren't, here's the [link to the kickoff post.](https://kevcisme.github.io/new-cohort/)

I'm starting out with Linear Regression (LR). I'll move from a simpler example to a more optimized implementations. Throughout this, you'll get a better intuition of LR and times where it's an appropriate model choice.

First, let's start with a linear equation:
```
y = 2x + 3
```
Depending on the value of `x` that you plug in, you'll receive a varying output, `y`. If you plot out the x and y numbers on a Cartesian plane, you'll see that this equates to a line.
