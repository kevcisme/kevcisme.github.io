title: Company Research for Those who go DEEP
---

I generally think that my preparation of a company before I go into an interview is a distinguishing trait. There are usually two smallish moments in any interview where this really helps set a tone though. These smallish moments can be incredibly beneficial though, especially for data science interviews because it spells out several incredibly important traits about you as a candidate:
	1. You are a person capable of doing research
	2. You are genuinely interested in this company (or alternatively, you've been following this company and waiting for a moment to strike)
	3. You care
	4. It instantly creates rapport with an interviewer. Companies are like conspiracies that employees are all in belief of (to paraphrase an investor/attorney). By knowing a bit more of the ins and outs of a company, you seem instantly like a co-conspirator

So, how to unlock this research? Let's go.
