title: Interview Questions for Data Science
---

Here's a list of questions that I've experienced in interviews or have asked in interviews.

Additionally, there are questions I've added in here to keep you on your toes with concepts.


### Statistics
1. What is a P Value?
2. What is Standard Deviation?
3. Would a dataset with a skewed distribution effect modeling?
4. What's the difference between the normal distribution and a binomial distribution?
5. Define a Z Score.
6. Explain kurtosis.
7. If I have a right tail skewed dataset, where are most of my values grouped and where is the outlier?

### Linear Algebra
1. Compare and contrast a vector norm with Mean Squared Error.
2. Describe a use case for a Kalman Filter
3. Describe the dot product. What are some useful applications of the dot product in machine learning?

## Language Questions

### Python 
1. Describe a time where you might use flask.
2. What are some libraries you've used for unit testing?
3. Python has uniform handling of sequences. Describe how you'd pull data from a dictionary, Pandas dataframe, and a list.

### R
1. Describe a time where you might use Plumber.
2. What are some libraries you've used for unit testing?
3. In dplyr, there is a character that is used to access a column from a table. What is that symbol?
