title: Deploy Your Own Knowledge Repo
---

One of the best ways to forget what you've done is to not catalog it somehow. Munger says that knowledge must hang on a [mental latticework](https://www.mymentalmodels.info/what-are-mental-models/) in your head, but I say that we should just let the internet remember everything for us. To that end, I'm going to talk about how to deploy a knowledge repository, using the open source tool that the titans over at AirBnB open sourced.

Alternatively, if you have read through the documentation and you still want to know how to deploy a knowledge repo... this post is also for you - just scroll down to the  sub header "Deploying a Knowledge Repo."
