Born when he was very small. Much bigger now.

### More Information

I'm a former paralegal turned data scientist. I work on predictive models for Fortune 50 companies and teach data science at night to entrpid data analysts. 

Because of my background in law, I've been incredibly interested in applying machine learning to solve problems that attorneys and paralegals frequently experience.

Because I like wine, my ongoing side hustle is winosaurus. winosaurus has several components to it. One of the most forward facing of these components is a mobile app. The mobile app recommends wine with several pretty smart machine learning models.
