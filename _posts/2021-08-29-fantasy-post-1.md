Hello to week 1. If you're new here, you can catch up by reading my introductory post [here](2021-08-22-fantasy-draft.md) where I explain the purpose of this series:
 
> Destroying my friends and crushing their spirits using math.

and I vulnerably talk about how it's difficult to be bad at something for > 20 years. I also hopefully did enough of the appropriate amount of qualifying up and down that this entire series is on its face supposed to be very humble and should in no way be construed as something serious.
